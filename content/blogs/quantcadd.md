## Overview 
The project explores how quantum computing is revolutionizing drug discovery by accelerating timelines and reducing costs in a traditionally lengthy and expensive process. It highlights quantum applications in key stages of drug development.

## Key Points

1. **Drug Development Process**
   - Involves target discovery, hit identification, lead optimization, preclinical/clinical trials, and typically spans 10-15 years with costs exceeding $2 billion.

2. **Role of Quantum Computing**
   - **Protein Structure Prediction**: Quantum algorithms optimize protein modeling, surpassing classical methods in some cases.
   - **Molecular Docking**: Quantum devices improve docking accuracy by identifying optimal binding poses.
   - **Quantum Simulations**: Used to solve complex quantum systems like protein-ligand interactions.
   - **QSAR Models**: Hybrid quantum-classical models predict compound activities with improved efficiency.

3. **Challenges and Future Directions**
   - Current quantum devices are limited by noise and scalability.
   - Hybrid quantum-classical approaches are critical until quantum technology matures.
   - Future research will focus on robust quantum algorithms and broader applications, such as patent analysis and ligand-based drug design.

## Conclusion
Quantum computing is poised to transform drug discovery by solving problems classical computers struggle with, making drug development faster, cheaper, and more efficient.
